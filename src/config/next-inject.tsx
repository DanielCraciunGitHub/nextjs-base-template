/**
 * This is the site configuration file.

 * Information like the website url, your email, and any sort of global configuration related to
 * your website should go here.
 *
 * @url This is used to prevent hardcoding urls within the code and have a consistent absolute URL
 * for both development and production.
 *
 * @navLinks This is optional, and it's used to automatically add navbar items if you performed `next-inject init`
 * This isn't available for bootstrapped projects. See src/components/Navbar to find the Navbar components.
 *
 * @socialLinks This is used to create social buttons on your website to redirect users to your social media. See how they
 * look like at https://www.danielfullstack.com/blog. See src/components/SocialLink.tsx and SocialLinksArray.tsx.
