/**
 * Get started by running the "dev" command with a package manager of your choice.
 * E.g. pnpm dev, or npm run dev.
 *
 * This is an example of a welcome email with these sections:
 *
 * @image The icon that represents the brand of your SaaS
 * @title The title that appears right below the image, typically your SaaS name.
 * @welcomeText A section that welcomes the user and could even be used for a CTA.
 * @footerText A section that shows additional information and an unsubscribe link, which could be implemented
 * with a `/unsubscribe` url on your page.
 *
 * These components can be used with popular email sending services like nodemailer and resend.
 * Be sure to check out my resend and nodemailer plugins over at https://nextinject.pro/plugins
